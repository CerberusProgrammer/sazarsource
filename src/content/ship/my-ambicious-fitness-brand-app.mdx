I know, I know. The title is a bit too much. But I'm really excited about this project! I've been working on this fitness app for a while now, and I'm finally ready to share my progress with you.

## The Idea

The idea for this app came to me when I was doing my daily workout. I had already six months doing the same routine (With variations) and I was getting bored. I wanted to try something new, but I didn't know where to start. That's when I thought:

> Wouldn't it be great if there was an app that could help me to only choose a routine that it's always new and challenging?

And that's how the idea for my fitness app was born.

## The Mindset Behind It

Okay, the idea has come, but that's not everything to me, I wanted to make sure that this app was going to be different from the others. I wanted to make sure that this app was going to be the best fitness app out there. So I started to think about what I could do to make it stand out.

I decided to focus on three main things:

1. **Variety**: This is a MUST for me. I wanted to make sure that the app would offer a wide range of routines so that users could always find something new and challenging to try, for every level.

2. **Personalization**: I wanted to make sure that the app would be able to adapt to the user's needs and preferences. I wanted to make sure that the app would be able to create a personalized workout plan for each user, based on their goals, fitness level, and preferences.

3. **Simple and Intuitive**: I wanted to make sure that the app would be easy to use and navigate. I wanted to make sure that the app would be user-friendly and intuitive, so that users could focus on their workout and not on figuring out how to use the app.

`Clean Abs` is a pretty easy name.
