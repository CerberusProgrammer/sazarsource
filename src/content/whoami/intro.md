I was feeling frustrated of how to do a great notes about anything, or how to redact my life, I use Notion but it gets me disappointing very quick because its difficult to share what i think with others.

Here is where you can read (or see) everything about me, my life, my knowledge, my products, and some other random stuff.

I'm a software engineer with a focus on software architecture and backend development. I'm passionate about building scalable and maintainable software systems. But in secret I'm a designer, I love to design and create new things, I'm always looking for new ways to improve my skills and learn new things.

But that's only about this world, I'm also a spiritual person, I love to meditate, to read about the universe or horror stories, I love to watch movies and series, I love to play video games, I love to travel, I love to eat, I love to sleep, I love to be alive.

Here you can find some of my thoughts, my projects, my knowledge, my life, my dreams, my fears, my goals, my failures, my successes, my everything.

> This is not only a blog, this is a source of my life.
