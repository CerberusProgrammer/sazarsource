I recently read the book [Code is for Human](https://www.amazon.com/Code-Humans-Human-Centric-Software-Engineering/dp/B0CN6PQ42B/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2Q36J6WN7C1PF&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.IyI9QNXKkX0Wyx_uElm3jCSZhrznm15yr0u1_M04kirdXgIQE9uequKO4YgjwGkX8fbZKh83HfmxgWt4JKop2nyP0Xw0OiEAsuKZheuz5LcQ4eOChVpXpofa4JCWY1-KQp8EVZCoE8bRO1cJPJsyGgB6cK9y3J4evei5O6Ijv4IWENGRmr6rfGVoiABuhlW1BJQWQTb-rhs3DT9hOXpGhnrj85zC0-rBLh7UKFcmR0M.SssVuq0sx4JNyPmwQnwobQ3EPH8mOijgL-zXKEoCHqI&dib_tag=se&keywords=code+is+for+human&qid=1727098994&sprefix=code+is+for+huma%2Caps%2C158&sr=8-1) by Zohar Jackson. The reason of Why I read this book is because I was so tired of another classic book that you only see code and more code of how to be `clean`, etc. I buy this book with 0 expectations and I was surprised, not because it's a must read book, but because it's a different book.

> Complexity probably increases as the square of the features: double the number of features, quadruple the complexity. Provide ten times as many features, multiply the complexity by one hundred.

**The book is about how to write code for humans, not for machines**. And damn, that was a break mind for me. Because in the school when you're in Software Engineering, they teach you how to write code for machines, not for humans. And that's a big mistake. As a programmer we always asume that our code is well written and will work oven 10 years (Also sometimes we don't think about that our client doesn't know what he want) but the reality is that we write code for humans, not for machines. And that's the main point of the book.

And I love that point, it's not about being a better programmer, or think in `Clean Architecture` or just put comments. It's about think first, think in the future, think in the other people that will read your code. And that's a big difference.

> There are no rules in software development that are appropriate in all circumstances. Following “best practices” and advice from pretty blog posts will lead to disaster if they are not filtered with judgment. This type of disaster is often caused by enthusiastic over-engineering, premature optimization, or wasteful perfectionism, topics we will cover later in this book.

I recommend this book if you're tired of the same books that you read every time that talks about code, or being a good programmer (Also with a very formal language). This book is different and change my mind about how to write code and think about how my code will be read by others.
