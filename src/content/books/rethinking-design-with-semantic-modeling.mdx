Recently I had the glorious opportunity to read the book ![Semantic Modeling for Data](https://www.amazon.com.mx/Semantic-Modeling-Data-Avoiding-Pitfalls-ebook/dp/B08GB7PNQT/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_es_MX=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&crid=218BV0EXQ34PI&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.MUtyHSOldH9THjoxCOqsubYoDfvRQvfCXyHcvwclkI_vvkmW7fd1J-eSU2byPbjRgJLqOmQ_MOGFWc2Bvqgp73hMfuf1phHRjqORz4oK3FEBpVv83rKbdM-biHL2a9F0loT9PdruGwUJrbiOuvij0KO05tqKL67RyLMlUTcgg4dOd302ma0f1XV0Og2fbv1813LRnto9gSB6xTdHQt9pXsH0et62b2hFShUbnlsJHLg4dfQsdKcuVdAjSk-IBNv785KE1EIhQl8agufewAJDt_evxEhdCH-cUHBq6WOD9uY.X1d-G5PRt80HP6K3vRJpGuWHFBP9SP-jZrE7JURStWU&dib_tag=se&keywords=semantic+modeling&qid=1729456702&sprefix=semantic+modelin%2Caps%2C312&sr=8-1) and was a really joyful read!.

I was in love about the idea of design databases using a very obvious way to understand the data, I always do that in my job, I hate when I see a database with a lot of tables and columns that I don't know what they are for, so I use a very obvious way to name the tables and columns, but I never thought that this could be a thing, and that's the main point of the book.

The book talks literally about semantic, grammar, and how to use it in your database design, and that's a very interesting point of view. I always thought that the database design was a very technical thing, but now I see that it's a very human thing, and that's a big difference. Because when you design a database you're not thinking in the machine, you're thinking in the people that will use that database, also, `the databases aren't only for the programmers, they're for the people that will use the system`, that crush my mind.

Because it's true, in my recently job, everyone talks about the database, but no one knows what the tables are for, and that's a big problem, because if you don't know what the tables are for, you can't use them properly, like a programmer like me, I understand because I write the code, but the people that use the system don't know what the tables are for, every departament require to understand the database.

So, I recommend this book if you're tired of the same books that you read every time that talks about design, or being a good programmer (Also with a very formal language). This book is different and change my mind about how to design databases and think about how my database will be used by others.
