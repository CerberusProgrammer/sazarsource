Every developer loves linux terminal, I can understand the hate for Windows Terminal, but it's not that bad if you are open to customization. And I'm not talking to use WSL or any other linux terminal, I'm talking about Windows Terminal and using ONLY PowerShell, not external terminals or shells.

## Why Windows Terminal?

Windows Terminal is a modern terminal application for users of command-line tools, aslo is fully open-source and it's available on the Microsoft Store, and very customizable!.

## Customizing Windows Terminal

### 1. Install Windows Terminal

First, you need to install Windows Terminal from the Microsoft Store, you can find it [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701?activetab=pivot:overviewtab).

### 2. Open Windows Terminal

Once you have installed Windows Terminal, you can open it from the Start menu or by searching for it in the search bar. You can also pin it to the taskbar or the Start menu for easy access.

### 2. Add your custom font to Windows Terminal

We got a lot of cool fonts to use in the terminal, but I recommend using Cascadia Code, it's a monospaced font that includes programming ligatures and is designed to enhance the look and feel of the Windows Terminal. You can download it from the [official GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code). (Also if you will use Cascia Code I recommend to use the PL version, it's the one with the ligatures).

To add the font to Windows Terminal (Assuming that you already installed it) justo go to the settings tab in Windows Terminal (Press `Ctrl + ,`) and then add the font to the profiles section in Additional options.

Cascadia Code is not for everyone, you can use any font you want, just make sure it's monospaced. I will give you a list of different fonts that you can use in the terminal.

- [JetBrains Mono (A beautiful and simple font)](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/)
- [Source Code Pro (A very popular font)](https://adobe-fonts.github.io/source-code-pro/)
- [Fira Code (A very popular font with ligatures)](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Code)
- [Hack (A very popular font)](https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/)
- [Inconsolata (A very popular font)](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inconsolata)
- [Monoid (A very popular font)](https://larsenwork.com/monoid/)
- [Ubuntu Mono (A very popular font)](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Ubuntu+Mono)
- [DejaVu Sans Mono (A very popular font)](https://dejavu-fonts.github.io/)

### 3. Add Custom Color Schemes

You can add custom color schemes to Windows Terminal by editing the schemes.json file, which is also located in the same folder as the settings.json file. You can add color schemes for the background, text, cursor, and other elements of the terminal.

If you don't know where is the %LOCALAPPDATA% folder or the settings.json file, you can find it in the Windows Terminal settings, just press `Ctrl + ,` and then click on the "Open JSON file" button (It's the first button from the left bottom).

When the file is opened, you can start customizing your terminal, you can change the color scheme, the font, the cursor shape, the background image, the key bindings, and many other things. I will give you a custom file with my settings, you can use it as a base for your own settings. (And is a super mega cool Cyberpunk theme).

```json
 "schemes":
    [
        {
            "background": "#1A1A2E",
            "black": "#0D0D0D",
            "blue": "#4E00FF",
            "brightBlack": "#808080",
            "brightBlue": "#0066FF",
            "brightCyan": "#00FFFF",
            "brightGreen": "#00FF66",
            "brightPurple": "#FF00FF",
            "brightRed": "#FF3300",
            "brightWhite": "#FFFFFF",
            "brightYellow": "#FFFF00",
            "cursorColor": "#FFFFFF",
            "cyan": "#00CCCC",
            "foreground": "#EAEAEA",
            "green": "#00FF00",
            "name": "VibrantCyberpunkScheme",
            "purple": "#FF00FF",
            "red": "#FF0055",
            "selectionBackground": "#333333",
            "white": "#EAEAEA",
            "yellow": "#FFFF66"
        }
    ],
```

Also, don't forget to add the color scheme to the profiles section in the settings.json file.

```json
 "profiles":
    {
        "defaults": {
            "colorScheme": "VibrantCyberpunkScheme"
        },
        "list":
        [
            {
                "adjustIndistinguishableColors": "always",
                "colorScheme": "VibrantCyberpunkScheme",
                "commandline": "%SystemRoot%\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe",
                "cursorShape": "underscore",
                "elevate": false,
                "font":
                {
                    "face": "Cascadia Code PL",
                    "size": 14,
                    "weight": "normal"
                },
                "guid": "{61c54bbd-c2c6-5271-96e7-009a87ff44bf}",
                "hidden": false,
                "intenseTextStyle": "all",
                "name": "Vibrant Cyberpunk PowerShell",
                "opacity": 85,
                "tabTitle": "Cyberpunk Shell",
                "useAcrylic": true
            }
        ]
    },
```

### 4. Add Custom Oh My Posh Theme

Oh My Posh is a prompt theme engine for any shell, it's very customizable and you can create your own themes or use the ones that are already created by the community. You can find more information about Oh My Posh [here](https://ohmyposh.dev/).

To install Oh My Posh you need to run the following command in PowerShell.

```powershell
Install-Module oh-my-posh -Scope CurrentUser
```

Once you have installed Oh My Posh, you can start customizing your prompt by editing the themes in the themes folder. You can also create your own themes by following the instructions on the Oh My Posh website.

A personal recommendation is [M365Princess](https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh/blob/main/themes/M365Princess.omp.json) theme, it's a very cool theme with a lot of information in the prompt and looks like Manjaro terminal.

Once you download the json file, you can import it to Oh My Posh by running the following command in PowerShell.

```powershell
Import-Module oh-my-posh -DisableNameChecking ; Import-Theme .\M365Princess.omp.json
```

And then reload the terminal to see the changes.

```
. $PROFILE
```

Also, don't forget to add to the PROFILE file the following line to load the theme every time you open the terminal.

```powershell
notepad $PROFILE
```

And then add the following line to the file.

```powershell
Import-Module oh-my-posh
oh-my-posh init pwsh --config 'C:\Users\Usuario\Documents\M365Princess.omp.json' | Invoke-Expression
```

### 5. Add auto-completion to PowerShell

PowerShell has a built-in auto-completion feature that allows you to quickly complete commands, parameters, and paths by pressing the `Tab` key. You can enable auto-completion in PowerShell by adding the following line to the PROFILE file.

```powershell
notepad $PROFILE
```

And then add the following line to the file.

```powershell
Set-PSReadLineKeyHandler -Key Tab -Function MenuComplete
```

### 6. Add custom aliases to PowerShell

You can add custom aliases to PowerShell by editing the PROFILE file, which is located in the same folder as the settings.json file. You can add aliases for common commands, functions, and scripts to make it easier to use them in the terminal.

```powershell
notepad $PROFILE
```

And then add the following lines to the file.

```powershell
Set-Alias -Name ll -Value Get-ChildItem
Set-Alias -Name la -Value Get-ChildItem -Force
Set-Alias -Name cls -Value Clear-Host
Set-Alias -Name c -Value Clear-Host
Set-Alias -Name np -Value Notepad
Set-Alias -Name code -Value code-insiders
Set-Alias -Name explorer -Value Start-Process
```

### 7. Add custom functions to PowerShell

You can add custom functions to PowerShell by editing the PROFILE file, which is located in the same folder as the settings.json file. You can add functions for common tasks, scripts, and utilities to make it easier to use them in the terminal.

```

And then add the following lines to the file.

```powershell
function Get-Weather {
    $url = "https://wttr.in"
    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $url
}
```

### 8. Install neovim for PowerShell!

Yes, you can use neovim in PowerShell, and it's very cool! You can install neovim by running the following command in PowerShell.

```powershell
winget install Neovim.Neovim

If this doesn't work, don't worry, try to using this command to set nvim in the path.

```powershell
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", $env:Path + ";C:\Program Files\Neovim\bin", [System.EnvironmentVariableTarget]::Machine)
```

### 9. Winfetch for... Shinies!
