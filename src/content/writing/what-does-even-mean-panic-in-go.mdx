In Go lang, we don't have `try` or `catch` blocks like in other languages. Instead, we have `panic` and `recover`. And it's a very good thing to use in your programs.

## What is panic?

`panic` is when something goes wrong in your program and you want to stop the execution of the program. It's like throwing an exception in other languages, but in Go, it's called `panic`. Why? Because it's a panic situation!!!

Okay, let's be serious. For Go lang, isn't `idiomatic` to use in every line a `try` and `catch` block, because the creator of Go, Rob Pike, believes that it's better to handle the error where it happens! And not every code should have a `try` and `catch` block, because this is a very specific situation, not a general one.

## How to use panic?

You can use `panic` in your code like this:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    triggerPanic()
}

func triggerPanic() {
    panic("Something went wrong!")
}
```

In this example, the `triggerPanic` function will panic and stop the execution of the program.

> But, what if I want to recover from the panic?

## How to recover from panic?

In Go lang we have also `recover` function that can be used to recover from a panic. But, you should use it wisely, because it's not a good practice to recover from every panic. You should recover only from the panics that you know how to handle.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    defer func() {
        if r := recover(); r != nil {
            fmt.Println("Recovered from panic:", r)
        }
    }()

    triggerPanic()
}
```

> The main diference between `try`/`catch` and `panic`/`recover` is that `panic`/`recover` are more general solution, because the panic get a propagaed up the stack, until it's recovered. And the `try`/`catch` is more specific, because you can catch only the exceptions that you want.
