I can say that my English is not perfect, and my level is intermediate. But as many other people like me I can guess that we don't know how to do the next step. Because I already can write, communicate and understand English, but with an awful expression and grammar. So in my mind I got an idea, and this is: If I just learn as a child learns as a native? With this question in my mind, I search a lot of books on Amazon (because I read in Kindle), and I found some books but as a first try to learn English as a child, I found the book "Perfect English Grammar" by Grant Barrett (Also, I like pretentious titles).

I haven't finish the book, but I like to make a dynamic blog of this, I'll leave some keynotes and highlights of the book, and I'll update this blog post when I finish the book.

## Best tips and motivation

> Avoid the urge to put writely tricks to work unless they come naturally to you. Simple does it. Before literary writers could do clever things with their work, they had to understand the ordinary ways of language. Basic language rules underlie everything they write.

> Think of words as bricks and boards, sentences as walls and windows, paragraphs as houses, and essays, stories, and articles as neighborhoods. Your writing is a little world for your readers, which you furnish in a way that, you hope, delighs them.

> **Writing is a learned process** that doesn't come naturally to anyone. We all must be taught it. Don't fret if you think you're behind where you should be. You can learn it, just as many millions people have before you. Hang in there.

> **Writing has different rules than speaking does.** What naturally comes out of our mouths may seem fine to us, but if we write it down exactly as we speal it, other people- who can't see out memories, emotions, knowledge, and ideas- will get only vague, misshapen impressions of what we mean. We must write differently than we speak.

> **Format at the end.** Thinks like bolding, italicizing, and setting margins can be distractions from what matter most. You'll end up having to redo a lot of the formatting, anyway.

> Don't be the person who doesn't recognize when it is the right time for formal versus informal language! Match the tone and register of your audience.

> **Tell someone else about your writing.** Some people feel that talking to anyone else will void their ideas of meaning, that in the telling, the magic is gone, and all that is left is dusty vagueness. But the important part is to ask the other person to tell your ideas back to you. You'll probably find yourself wanting to correct what they're saying, or add to their words. As the two of you discuss your project, take notes. Take lots of notes as quickly as you can. Those notes become your outline.

> **Make a puzzle for your self.** Think of yourself as both a puzzle-maker and a puzzle-solver. You don't know which paragraph will be the first one until you've written them all down and can see what's what. Then, you can rearrange each of the bits untils you find a pleasing order. Hunter S. Thompson was known for sending his stories to the editors of Rolling Stone in long stream of faxes. One in the office, the faxes were cut into pages and paragraphs, and then rearranged on the floor: editing was like solving a jigsaw puzzle.

### My favorite tip!

> **Start at the end.** If your hero dies in the end, write that first. Then, write that happened right before the hero died. And then write what happened before that. Keep working backward until you reach beginning of the story. This is aslso works for speeches, essays and even complicated emails: put down your final, summarizing thoughts, and then justify them.

> **Write the fun part first:** the big love scene, the explanation of all the convincing survey data, the recital of the project that won you a promotion, the anecdote that perfectly illustrates the spirit of what you're doing.

# Paragraph Structure

A paragraph is the foundation of writing structure. In many ways, it mimics the larger structure of typical essay. Each paragraph contains one or more sentences, which generally cover one subject.

- Topic
- Body
- Conclusion

This is a general structure. Different kinds of writing can condense or stretch this form from one sentence to a page of paragraphs. Besides those three parts, paragraphs have two important characteristics.

- They contain one main idea.
- They have multiple sentences.

How do you know when to starta paragraph?

- When introducing a essay or a new idea.
- When concluding an essay or finish the discuss of an idea when an existing paragrah seems to contain too many ideas (in which case, move each main idea into its own paragrah) when trying to avoid a big unbroken block of words or "wall of text" which can be intimadating Paragraphs can be any length, but good writers usually try to break down long paragraphs into several shorter paragraphs.

No matter how long a paragraph is, it should have a reason to be there, and have a job to do (a job that isn't simply about making the writing longer, or trying to impress the reader). Broken-out shorter paragraphs are stylistic, but they can still contain discrete ideas. Just look carefully at your words and figure out where the natural separation points are.

## Paragraph Topic

The topic sentence for a paragraph is usually the first sentence. It should be broad, with just enough information to introduce the ideas that will be explained in more detail within the paragraph, or in other paragraphs. In more sophisticated writing, or in a longer essay, the topic sentence (or topic phrase) can appear anywhere in the paragraph, but it is always there.

## Paragraph Body

The body is where the majority of the paragraph's work is done. It explains more specifically what was hinted at in the topic sentence, and answers any questions that may have appeared in the reader's mind. The supporting sentences not only explain, but also justify the topic sentence: they give proof to its statements, legitimize it, analyze it, and break it down into smaller, explainable parts.

There are many kinds of good supporting sentences:

- Descriptions
- Data, such as statistics
- Quotes or paraphrases of others words
- Examples
- Definitions of important terminology
- Contrasts and comparisons a timeline or step-by-step report of what happened

## Paragraph Conclusion

The concluding sentence summarizes what has been said, or presents the natural final thought that should occur in the reader's mind when all the paragraph's ideas or actions are put together. Many times, the conclusion restates the topic sentence. In a story or other kind of sequential narrative, the conclusion tends to include consequences and outcomes. In other cases, the conclusion is an observation, which more or less says, "Given what we've learned in this paragraph, X is true, Y is not, and we don't know about Z."
