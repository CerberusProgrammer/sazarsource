Let me explain the context of my company. We are a medium-sized company with a new team of developers. This new team was formed to create a new product using modern technologies (Because there is another team that maintains the old product with a really old technology as _**WebDev**_). The new team was formed with the idea of using Java Spring Boot as the main technology because the old team is using it and this was a better idea to homologate the technologies in the company.

But, we are a new team, and they want a lot of new products with a lot of new features in a very short time. So, we started to working with a new project (builded by another external company). This 'new' project was a mess, the code was a mess, the architecture was a mess, the deployment was a mess, everything was a mess. And we started to work with this project, and we started to see that we were not going to be able to deliver the new features in the time that the company wanted.

Why this project was a mess? Because the external company that built this project was a company that doesn't have a lot of experience with Java Spring Boot, viewing the code you can see that they were trying to do the things in the way that they know, but they were not doing the things in the right way. But I can't blame them, because they were trying to do the best that they can do in a super short time (because the company wanted the project to be delivered in a super short time).

And as a new team, the external company give us the project and we started to work with it. And we started to see that we were not going to be able to deliver the new features in the time that the company wanted, we made a fix of all of this with a lot of new things, changing microservices to RESTful APIs, changing the architecture to a more clean architecture, changing the deployment to a more clean deployment, and we started to see that we were not going to be able to deliver the new features in the time that the company wanted, because there was a lot of things that we need to do to fix the project. This was the climax to make a really big decision. We need to change the technology, we need to change the _framework_.

In the discussion to change the technology, we started to see that we need to change the technology to a technology that we know, a technology that we have experience with, a technology that we can deliver the new features in the time that the company wanted. Having this in mind, we took a look to some _frameworks_ as _**Django**_, _**Ruby on Rails**_, and _**Laravel**_. Every _framework_ has its pros and cons, but we decided to go with _**Django**_ because we have experience with Python, and we know that Python is a language that is easy to learn, easy to read, and easy to write. And we started to work with _**Django**_, and we started to see that we were going to be able to deliver the new features in the time that the company wanted (We build and entire new API in 2 weeks, and we were able to deliver the new features in the time that the company wanted).

This was incredible, we were able to deliver the new features in a record time, changing to _**Django**_ was a really good decision. Now we can write code fast and zero complexity, we can deploy the code in a super short time. But not everything was perfect, we had some problems with the migration of the data, we had some problems with the integration of the new API with the old API, we had some problems with the integration of the new API with the frontend, but we were able to solve all of this problems in a super short time (but this is another story).

And how we convice the company to change to a robust _framework_ as Spring Boot to _**Django**_? We show them the results. We ignore the status quo of the company and we show them the results. We show them that we were able to deliver the new features in the time that they wanted (Also the entire team are more happy üòÅ).

In conclusion, not everything need to be optimized, the happiness of the team is more important. Also this advice is not for everyone, this advice is for the people that are in the same situation that I was, also, keep in mind the context, and is a mid-sized company, with a new team, with a new project, with a lot of new features in a super short time. Every product has to evolve, maybe we win this fight changing to _**Django**_ and building fast, but maybe in the future we need to change to another _framework_, who knows? But for now, we are happy with _**Django**_.

I hope this story helps you to make a decision in the future. If you have any questions, feel free to ask me. I will be happy to help you.
