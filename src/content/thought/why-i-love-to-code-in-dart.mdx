Dart is a programming language developed by Google and it's used to build web, mobile, and server applications. And... That's what everyone knows about Dart. But, why I love to code in Dart? Let me explain.

Any programming language has his own good ideas and bad ideas. **_Java_** has a very good ideas with managing memory, but it's a very verbose language (I love verbose languages, but with **_Java_** it's too much) also, I love how **_Java_** manage his objects, but I hate the `new` keyword.

In JavaScript, I love how you can write code in a very fast way, but I hate the `this` keyword and how you can write code in a very fast way (Yes, I love and hate the same thing), also I really hate that is too flexible of how you write code.

As you can see I like very strong typed languages and very weak typed languages. And this is a reason of why I love to code in Dart. Dart is a very strong typed language, but you can write code in a very fast way. Also, Dart has a very good syntax and is very easy to read.
