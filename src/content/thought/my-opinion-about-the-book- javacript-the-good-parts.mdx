![JavaScript: The Good Parts](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1000/1*VTr3QXEKpkCNutkVwWlmWA.png)

When someone search for a book about anything related to programming languages, the first book that usually is in the list is the book "JavaScript: The Good Parts". The title is a little bit pretentious in my opinion, because I don't think that in the book the author resolve the problem in his own title.

Don't get me wrong, I feel the book as a really too beginner book. Has all the essential information that you need to know about JavaScript, but I think that the author could go a little bit further in the book. I think that the author could explain more about the good parts of JavaScript and how you can use it in your daily basis. But I can't say that the book is bad, because it's not, I learn a few things more, but if you are a JavaScript developer with a minimum of one year of experience, you will not learn too much with this book.

I really recommend this book if you don't know anything about JavaScript and plus you don't understand why JavaScript is so bad designed.
