Well, if you're reading this, I'm sure that you're a developer. Talking about us, developers, we have a lot of ways to code and no one is the right way. But for me there are some things that I like to do when I'm coding.

I'll list my most important thinks to do/have but isn't in order of importance, so take whatever you want from this list.

### 1. **Music**

Come on, who doesn't like to listen to music while coding? If you don't, you should try it (Or may be you're a psychopath or working from home) because music can keep you focused and motivated, also, if you're in a noisy place, music can help you to isolate from the noise (Cries in open office).

I don't have a specific play list, but sometimes is graeat to listen a long mix of music, like a 1 hour mix of lo-fi hip hop, or a 2 hours mix of jazz, or a 3 hours mix of classical music, etc.

### 2. **Coffee**

You're happy until you got up to 25 years old, then you start to drink coffee, and you can't stop. Coffee is a great way to keep you awake and focused, also, it's a great way to take a break, because you need to go to the bathroom every 30 minutes (Cries in coffee addiction).

My personal recommendation. Stop using sugar in your coffee, you'll thank me later. Also, try to drink a good coffee (Up to $10 per 500g), and use a good milk in your coffee because this is the 70% of taste of your coffee.

My favorite way to make my coffee is with a french press and then got a Cafe au Lait. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caf%C3%A9_au_lait
