Well, if you're reading this, I'm sure that you're a developer. Talking about us, developers, we have a lot of ways to code and no one is the right way. But for me there are some things that I like to do when I'm coding.

I'll list my most important thinks to do/have but isn't in order of importance, so take whatever you want from this list.

### 1. **Music**

Come on, who doesn't like to listen to music while coding? If you don't, you should try it (Or may be you're a psychopath or working from home) because music can keep you focused and motivated, also, if you're in a noisy place, music can help you to isolate from the noise (Cries in open office).

I don't have a specific play list, but sometimes is graeat to listen a long mix of music, like a 1 hour mix of lo-fi hip hop, or a 2 hours mix of jazz, or a 3 hours mix of classical music, etc.

A personal recommendation: https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=0t6HJZfIMPU&si=GOLAISW80cnSsdeW

> Actualization: I'm actually in love to work listening a new band called [Ghostly Kisses](https://music.youtube.com/channel/UCZdcdkgw9Jnt8ZlfUXUyyFw)

### 2. **Coffee**

You're happy until you got up to 25 years old, then you start to drink coffee, and you can't stop. Coffee is a great way to keep you awake and focused, also, it's a great way to take a break, because you need to go to the bathroom every 30 minutes (Cries in coffee addiction).

My personal recommendation. Stop using sugar in your coffee, you'll thank me later. Also, try to drink a good coffee (Up to $10 per 500g), and use a good milk in your coffee because this is the 70% of taste of your coffee.

My favorite way to make my coffee is with a french press and then got a Cafe au Lait. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caf%C3%A9_au_lait

### 3. **Environment**

My desktop is essential to me, I don't want to talk about my setup, because I'm not a hardware guy, but I want to talk how to love youre environment.

1. ** Keep it clean **: When I see my desk dirty my motivation to work goes down, so I try to keep it clean and organized.
2. ** Keep it simple **: I hate to have a lot of things in my desk, so I try to keep it simple, only the things that I need to work. My combo is alway has: Monitor, mouse, keyboard, tablet and a cup of coffee. No more than that.
3. ** Keep it quiet **: The reason why I have a tablet is because I don't want to have my phone in my desk, because I don't want to be distracted by notifications, so I use my tablet to see the time and the notifications (But usually I turn off the notifications).
4. ** Keep it minimal **: When I read the book `Deep Work`, I learned that the best way to be focus on your work is to have zero distraction and your work environment is a big part of it. A simple good recomendation is STOP multiple windows in your computer, only the necessary windows to work and if you can keep that windows on `FULLSCREEN` mode. This is because you don't see any other thing that can distract you, only your work.

### 4. **Tools**

I'm a dev, so this is a necessary section and I always use my essentials tools to work.

1. **VSCode**: My toxic relationship. I can't live with the comfort that offers me `VS Code`.
2. **Github Copilot**: My new love. Super helpful.
3. **Docker**: My best friend, all my databases or local servers are in Docker.
4. **Postman/Hoppscotch/Curl**: I like `Postman` but sometimes it's too much for me, or simply I don't like too much the design it has. So I use `Hoppscotch` or `Curl` to make my requests.
5. **Notion**: My second brain. I use `Notion` to keep all my notes, ideas, and tasks.
6. **Figma**: More than a design tool, I use `Figma` to make my ideas, moodboards, and even my presentations, everything refers to a visual I use `Figma`.

### 5. **Methodology**

Even my methodology is very simple, I don't use any fancy methodoly, it's a mix of `Kanban` and `Pomodor` technique. I use `Kanban` to keep track of my tasks and `Pomodor` to keep me focused on my tasks.
