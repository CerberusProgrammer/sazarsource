What does it mean to be an eternal student? For me, it means always being curious, always learning, always growing. It means never being satisfied with what you know, always seeking to know more. It means being open to new ideas, new experiences, new ways of thinking. It means embracing change, embracing uncertainty, embracing the unknown.

But being an eternal student is not just about acquiring knowledge. It's also about applying that knowledge, putting it into practice, using it to solve problems, to create new things, to make a difference in the world. It's about being a lifelong learner, a lifelong creator, a lifelong explorer.

And that's what I hate about a lot of people, they think they know everything, they think they have all the answers, they think they have nothing left to learn. But the truth is, there's always more to learn, always more to discover, always more to explore. And that's what makes life so exciting, so challenging, so rewarding. That's what makes being an eternal student so fulfilling, so enriching, so empowering. That's what makes it worth it.

If you're a self-taught developer, you know what I'm talking about. You know how hard it is to learn new things, to master new skills, to keep up with the latest technologies. But you also know how rewarding it is, how satisfying it is, how empowering it is. You know how much you've grown, how much you've accomplished, how much you've changed. And you know that you're not done yet, that there's still so much more to learn, so much more to do, so much more to be.
