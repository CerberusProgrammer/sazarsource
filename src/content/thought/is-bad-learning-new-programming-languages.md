When I was in high school, my teacher says that is truly unnecessary to learn new programming languages, because is better to be perfet in one language than to be average in many, and some other people think that this is a true fact, but for all that people that think that, I just can say that they are wrong.

Wrong in the sens that learning new programming languages is not just about learning a new syntax, is about learning a new way to think, a new way to solve problems, a new way to create things. It's about expanding your horizons, broadening your perspective, challenging your assumptions. It's about pushing yourself out of your comfort zone, stretching your limits, growing beyond your boundaries.

Also, if you're work requires Java, and you only know Java, you're limiting yourself to Java jobs, Java projects, Java opportunities. But if you know Java, Python, JavaScript, C++, you're opening yourself up to a world of possibilities, a world of opportunities, a world of challenges. You're making yourself more marketable, more versatile, more valuable. You're giving yourself the freedom to choose, the power to change, the confidence to succeed.

So, is bad learning new programming languages? No, it's not bad, it's good. I amply recommend to learn new programming languages, because it will make you a better developer, also in the book "The Pragmatic Programmer" says that you should learn at least one new programming language every year, and I think that's a good advice, because maybe you'll never use that language in your work but you can learn to think different, build different.

When I was using Flutter two years ago, I was so closed to use only Provider because is the most MVC pattern that I know, but then I learned React, with his hooks, and I was amazed by how easy is to use it, and how powerful is to use it, also a really easy to view and control the state, then when i check Riverpod in Flutter is like a mix of both, and I was so happy to learn it, because I can use the best of both worlds.
