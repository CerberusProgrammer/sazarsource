Well well well, I already read the book "HTML 5" and I want to share my opinion about it. I was so excited to read this book because I'm a web developer and I want to know more about the new features of HTML 5. But I was so disappointed with the book. The book is too old, and the author doesn't explain the new features of HTML 5.

I understand the time, but I think that the author could update the book with the new features of HTML 5, or at least talking more about a simple function in HTML, the author even try to explain the function, I was expecting that to be honest, because I always thing of how works a `<button>` tag in HTML, but he only talks about his properties, no examples, no explanation, nothing.

I don't recommend this book if you are a web developer and want to know more about HTML 5, because you will not learn anything new with this book. I think that the author could update the book with the new features of HTML 5, or at least talking more about the basics of HTML, but he doesn't. I'm so disappointed with this book. And again, this is another useless (In the present time) and overpriced book from the editorial O'Reilly.
